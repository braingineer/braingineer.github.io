> So, I finally have a blog!

### Hello World

- I have been meaning to make a blog for several years.  Whether it's to practice writing, disseminate ideas, or share intuitions, I've always thought it would be cool to have a blog.  And now, I finally do!
- I plan on using this blog for several purposes.  First, to write simple intuition-sharing posts for my students at [HEROES Academy](http://njgifted.org).  Second, to practice writing for a wider audience.  Being good at technical writing is like any skill: it gets better with quality practice.
